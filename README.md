# game-1
A clone of Pikmin, made with the 3D graphics engine Three.js (all game logic is written by me). Roam a small world, using your small red helpers to access new areas.
<br>Controls:
<ul><li>WASD: move</li><li>Left click: throw Pikmin</li><li>Right click: call Pikmin</li><li>Move mouse: move cursor (and camera, if moved to edge of screen)</li><li>Q: dismiss Pikmin</li><li>Shift: hold to direct Pikmin in a direction</li></ul>
Throw Pikmin at pellets to have them carry them back to the floating box, which will release more Pikmin. Throw Pikmin at walls and stick bundles to have them do work.
